						<h3> Our Process</h3>
						<p>To begin, we knew what we wanted to learn and achieve by completing this project. All we had
							to do was
							scour the web to find a dataset that would help us achieve our
							goals. Lucky for us, our group had several baseball fans so they knew exactly where to look
							to get our data (oddsportal.com). We then had to clean the data and make it usable for our
							analysis. The data
							came as an Excel file so we had to convert the file to a csv, remove
							unwanted columns and
							rows and rename all the of the rows so that we could easily access the data through our
							code. With a clean dataset, we set out to conquer our analysis. Each person in the group
							took a question to answer and picked the language/ platform that they thought was best to do
							the best analysis. Meanwhile, we set out to create an interactive webpage to display our
							final product. From there, all of the pieces came together and we were able to create
							visualizations that allows us to visually analyze the data easily. Along with this, we
							worked
							on an interactive machine learning application that would allow anyone who accesses the
							webpage to make a prediction and analysis of their own. </p>
						<h3>Challenges</h3>
						<p>
						<ul>
							<li> We ran into difficulties with the names of the columns. We had to go through and
								rename most of the columns to make them accessible.</li>
							<li>Because the data came from an Excel Sheet, the data was not formatted properly for our
								analysis and we needed to remove some empty or unsuable columns</li>
							<li>The Excel sheet also contained inconsistent rows. There were rows that did not follow
								the correct columns so they needed to be removed. We used our Jupyter Notebook to remove
								any empty and unuseable rows.</li>
							<li>
								The last challenge was the challenge to make the machine learning application. It took a
								lot of research and perserverance to figure out the best way to make the application
								work and to use it on our webpage.
							</li>
